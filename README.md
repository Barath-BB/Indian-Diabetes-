# Indian Diabetes Prediction 

This project predicts whether a person is diabetic or not using machine learning models trained on health-related features.

##  Dataset Features

- Pregnancies  
- Glucose  
- BloodPressure  
- SkinThickness  
- Insulin  
- BMI  
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction  
- Age  
- Outcome (0 = Not Diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)

##  How to Run

1. Open the notebook:
diabetes detection.ipynb

2. Run the code cells to train models and see predictions.

> Make sure required libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, and `matplotlib` are installed.

## Models Used

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

##  Goal

To compare ML algorithms and identify the best model for predicting diabetes based on Indian demographic and health data.
